# MAKING A MEMORY GAME

## PREREQUISITES

- Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS.
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript syntax and datatypes.
- ES6 and some basic DOM concepts.


## GOALS

The premise of the game is to have a grid of 24 face-down cards. The card faces consist of pairs of matches. Clicking on cards will flip them over, revealing the value. When two are chosen, if it's a match, both cards will disappear. If it's not, the cards will flip back over to face-down. The game should be different every time the game is refreshed.


## PLANNING

[ ] Display 12 cards.
[ ] Duplicate the cards to have 2 sets of 12.
[ ] Randomize the display of cards.
[ ] Add selected style for selected cards.
[ ] Only allow two cards to be selected at a time.
[ ] Determine if two selected cards are a match and hide them.
[ ] Reset guess count after 2.
[ ] Add delay to selections.
[ ] Show back of card initially and flip on select
[ ] Finished game!
