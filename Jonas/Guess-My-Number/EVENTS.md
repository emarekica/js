# TYPES OF EVENTS

1. **W3 DOM Specification**

W3C manages all the DOM event specifications, except those that deal with form elements.

2. **HTML5 Specification**

These include all the events specifically used with HTML. These include submit, input, etc. New additions to this category include hashchange, beforeunload, etc.

3. **Browser Object Models** 

W3 specifications donâ€™t yet cover these events. They deal with touchscreen devices and the events in this section include touchstart, touchend, etc.
