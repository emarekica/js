# Looping Arrays, Breaking and Continuing

[x] Let's bring back the 'populations' array from a previous assignment.

[x] Use a for loop to compute an array called 'percentages2' containing the percentages of the world population for the 4 population values.

Use the function 'percentageOfWorld1' that you created earlier.


[x] Confirm that 'percentages2' contains exactly the same values as the
'percentages' array that we created manually in the previous assignment, and reflect on how much better this solution is.
