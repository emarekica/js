# Function Declarations vs. Expressions

1. The world population is 7900 million people. Create a function declaration called 'percentageOfWorld1' which receives a 'population' value, and returns the percentage of the world population that the given population represents. For example, China has 1441 million people, so it's about 18.2% of the world population.

2. To calculate the percentage, divide the given 'population' value by 7900 and then multiply by 100.

3. Call 'percentageOfWorld1' for 3 populations of countries of your choice, store the results into variables, and log them to the console.

4. Create a function expression which does the exact same thing, called 'percentageOfWorld2', and also call it with 3 country populations (can be the same populations).
