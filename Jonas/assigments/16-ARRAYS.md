# Introduction to Arrays

[x] Create an array containing 4 population values of 4 countries of your choice.
You may use the values you have been using previously.
Store this array into a variable called 'populations'.

[x] Log to the console whether the array has 4 elements or not (true or false).

[ ] Create an array called 'percentages' containing the percentages of the
world population for these 4 population values.
Use the function 'percentageOfWorld1' that you created earlier to compute the 4
percentage values.
