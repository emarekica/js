# Coding Challenge 1
<br>

Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula:

  BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height)
  (mass in kg and height in meter).
<br>

## Your tasks:

- [x] Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables.
- [x] Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both versions).
- [x] Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
<br>

## Test data:

**Data 1**: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall.
John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.

**Data 2**: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall.
John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall.
