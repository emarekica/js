Given an array of forecasted maximum temperatures, the thermometer displays a string with the given temperatures. 

_Example_: [17, 21, 23] will print `... 17ºC in 1 days ... 21ºC in 2 days ... 23ºC in 3 days ...`

## Your tasks:

- [x] Create a function `printForecast` which takes in an array `arr` and logs a string like the above to the console.
Try it with both test datasets.

- [x] Use the problem-solving framework: Understand the problem and break it up into sub-problems!

**Test data**:

_§ Data 1_: [17, 21, 23]
_§ Data 2_: [12, 5, -5, 0, 4]
