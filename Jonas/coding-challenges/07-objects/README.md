# OBJECTS

Let's go back to Mark and John comparing their BMIs! This time, let's use objects to implement the calculations! 

Remember: BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass
/ (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter)

    ** = exponentiation operator (na kvadrat, na kub... )

## Your tasks:

[x] For each of them, create an object with properties for their full name, mass, and height (Mark Miller and John Smith).

[x] Create a 'calcBMI' method on each object to calculate the BMI (the same methoD on both objects).
Store the BMI value to a property, and also return it from the method.

[x] Log to the console who has the higher BMI, together with the full name and the respective BMI.

Example: "John's BMI (28.3) is higher than Mark's (23.9)!"

 ## PSEUDOCODE

    console.log(mark.calcBMI());  //
    console.log(john.calcBMI());  // 

    TERNARY operator instead of if/else
    
    if ( markBMI > johnBMI ) {
        console.log("Mark's BMI (mark.calcBMI()) is higher than John's BMI (john.calcBMI())!"
    }
      else {
        console.log("John's BMI (john.calcBMI()) is higher than Mark's BMI (mark.calcBMI())!"
      }

      ili

    higherBMI = markBMI > johnBMI ? `Mark's BMI ${mark.calcBMI()} is higher than John's BMI ${john.calcBMI()}!` : `John's BMI ${john.calcBMI()} is higher than Mark's BMI ${mark.calcBMI()}!`;
