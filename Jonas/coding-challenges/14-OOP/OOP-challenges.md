<br>

[x] Use a constructor function to implement a 'Car'.
A car has a 'make' and a 'speed' property.
The 'speed' property is the current speed of the car in
km/h.
<br>

[x] Implement an 'accelerate' method that will increase the car's speed by 10, and log the new speed to the console.
<br>

[x] Implement a 'brake' method that will decrease the car's speed by 5, and log the new speed to the console.
<br>

[x] Create 2 'Car' objects and experiment with calling 'accelerate' and 'brake' multiple times on each of them.
<br>
<br>

## Test data:

- ยง Data car 1: 'BMW' going at 120 km/h
- ยง Data car 2: 'Mercedes' going at 95 km/h
