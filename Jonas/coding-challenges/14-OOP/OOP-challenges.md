## 1

<br>
<br>

[x] Use a constructor function to implement a 'Car'.
A car has a 'make' and a 'speed' property.
The 'speed' property is the current speed of the car in km/h.
<br>

[x] Implement an 'accelerate' method that will increase the car's speed by 10, and log the new speed to the console.
<br>

[x] Implement a 'brake' method that will decrease the car's speed by 5, and log the new speed to the console.
<br>

[x] Create 2 'Car' objects and experiment with calling 'accelerate' and 'brake' multiple times on each of them.
<br>
<br>

**Test data:**

- § Data car 1: 'BMW' going at 120 km/h
- § Data car 2: 'Mercedes' going at 95 km/h
  <br>

## 2

<br>
<br>

[x] Re-create Challenge #1, but this time using an ES6 class (call it 'CarCl').
<br>

[] Add a getter called 'speedUS' which returns the current speed in mi/h (divide by 1.6).
<br>

[x] Add a setter called 'speedUS' which sets the current speed in mi/h (but converts it to km/h before storing the value, by multiplying the input by 1.6).
<br>

[x] Create a new car and experiment with the 'accelerate' and 'brake' methods, and with the getter and setter.
<br>
<br>

**Test data:**

Data car 1: 'Ford' going at 120 km/h
