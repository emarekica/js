- [x] Use a constructor function to implement a `Car`.
A car has a `make` and a 'speed' property. The `speed` property is the current speed of the car in km/h.
<br>

[x] Implement an `accelerate` method that will increase the car's speed by 10, and log the new speed to the console.
<br>

- [x] Implement a `brake` method that will decrease the car's speed by 5, and log the new speed to the console.
<br>

- [x] Create 2 `Car` objects and experiment with calling `accelerate` and `brake` multiple times on each of them.

**Test data**:

- _ยง Data car 1_: `BMW` going at 120 km/h
- _ยง Data car 2_: `Mercedes` going at 95 km/h
