# ARRAY METHODS - CODING CHALLENDE

<br><br>

## Part 1

<br>

Julia and Kate are doing a study on dogs. So each of them asked 5 dog owners about their dog's age, and stored the data into an array (one array for each). For now, they are just interested in knowing whether a dog is an adult or a puppy. A dog is an adult if it is at least 3 years old, and it's a puppy if it's less than 3 years old.

<br><br>

**Task**

<br>

Create a function `checkDogs`, which accepts 2 arrays of dog's ages (`dogsJulia` and `dogsKate`), and does the following things:
<br>

1. Julia found out that the owners of the first and the last two owners actually have cats, not dogs! So create a shallow copy of Julia's array, and remove the cat ages from that copied array (because it's a bad practice to mutate function parameters).
   <br><br>

2. Create an array with both Julia's (corrected) and Kate's data.
   <br><br>

3. For each remaining dog, log to the console whether it's an adult ("Dog number 1 is an adult, and is 5 years old") or a puppy ("Dog number 2 is still a puppy üê∂").
   <br><br>

4. Run the function for both test datasets.
   <br><br>

**Test data**

<br>

- **Data 1**: Julia's data [3, 5, 2, 12, 7], Kate's data [4, 1, 15, 8, 3]
- **Data 2**: Julia's data [9, 16, 6, 8, 3], Kate's data [10, 5, 6, 1, 4]
  <br><br><br>

## Part 2

<br>

Let's go back to Julia and Kate's study about dogs. This time, they want to convert dog ages to human ages and calculate the average age of the dogs in their study.
<br><br>

**Task**

<br>

Create a function `calcAverageHumanAge`, which accepts an arrays of dog's ages (`ages`), and does the following things in order:
<br>

1.  Calculate the dog age in human years using the following formula:

        if the dog is <= 2 years old, humanAge = 2 * dogAge
        if the dog is > 2 years old, humanAge = 16 + dogAge * 4

    <br><br>

2.  Exclude all dogs that are less than 18 human years old (which is the same as keeping dogs that are at least 18 years old).
    <br><br>

3.  Calculate the average human age of all adult dogs (you should already know from other challenges how we calculate averages üòâ).
    <br><br>

4.  Run the function for both test datasets.
    <br><br>

**Test data**

<br>

- Data 1: [5, 2, 4, 1, 15, 8, 3]
- Data 2: [16, 6, 10, 5, 6, 1, 4]
